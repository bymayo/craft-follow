# Follow Plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

Follow is a Craft CMS plugin that lets users follow elements within Craft. E.g. Users can follow other users, and create a 'Following List', or follow categories to then generate a bespoke entries feed.

ðŸ›’ [View on the Plugin Store](https://plugins.craftcms.com/strava-sync)<br>

## Features

- Follow Craft and other plugin elements (E.g. Users, Categories, Tags)
- Generate a 'Following' and 'Followers' list for a user.

## Documentation

## Support

If you have any issues (Surely not!) then I'll aim to reply to these as soon as possible. If it's a site-breaking-oh-no-what-has-happened moment, then hit me up on the Craft CMS Discord - @bymayo

## Roadmap

* Different lists per `siteId`.
* Ajax for follow buttons .
* Limits on queries.
* Auto output users elements, rather than passing a list.
* Notifications.
* Accept / Deny the follow request.
